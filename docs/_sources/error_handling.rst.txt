Error Handling and Troubleshooting
==================================

This section covers common errors and issues you may encounter when using the AI Vision Library, along with tips and strategies for troubleshooting and resolving these problems.

**Common Errors**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**1. `CUDA not available` or `CUDA out of memory`**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Description**: These errors occur when the library is configured to use GPU acceleration, but CUDA is either not installed, not available, or there isn't enough GPU memory to handle the operation.

**Solutions**:
- **Check CUDA Installation**: Ensure that CUDA is correctly installed and that your environment is configured to recognize it. You can verify this by running `nvidia-smi` in the terminal.
- **Fallback to CPU**: If CUDA is not available, set `device='cpu'` in the function parameters to use the CPU instead.
- **Optimize Memory Usage**: If you encounter an out-of-memory error, try reducing the input image size, decreasing batch sizes, or using models with fewer parameters.

.. code-block:: python

    # Example of falling back to CPU
    detected_objects = detect_objects(image, threshold=0.5, device='cpu')

**2. Invalid image format or Image loading failed**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Description**: This error occurs when the input image is not in the expected format, such as an unsupported file type, corrupted file, or incorrectly loaded image.

**Solutions**:
- **Verify Image Format**: Ensure that the image is loaded as a NumPy array, typically using OpenCV’s `cv2.imread()` function.
- **Check Image Path**: Ensure that the image path is correct and that the file is accessible.

.. code-block:: python

    # Correct way to load an image using OpenCV
    image = cv2.imread('sample_image.jpg')
    if image is None:
        print("Failed to load image")

**3. Model not found or Failed to load model**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Description**: This error occurs when the library fails to load a pre-trained model or custom model file. This could be due to an incorrect file path, missing files, or unsupported model formats.

**Solutions**:
- **Check Model Path**: Ensure that the model file path is correct and that the file exists.
- **Verify Model Format**: Confirm that the model is saved in a supported format, such as `.h5` or `.pt`.
- **Re-download or Re-train**: If using a pre-trained model, consider re-downloading it. If using a custom model, you may need to re-train and save it again.

.. code-block:: python

    # Example of loading a model
    model = load_model('my_model.h5')
    if model is None:
        print("Failed to load model")

**4. Unexpected keyword argument or TypeError**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Description**: This error occurs when a function is called with an incorrect argument or data type, typically due to a typo or misunderstanding of the function’s parameters.

**Solutions**:
- **Double-check Function Signatures**: Review the function documentation to ensure that all arguments are correctly named and of the expected type.
- **Use Default Parameters**: If unsure about certain parameters, consider using the function’s default values.

.. code-block:: python

    # Example of correct function call
    detected_objects = detect_objects(image=image, threshold=0.5, device='cuda')

**Debugging Tips**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Enable Verbose Logging**: When troubleshooting, enable verbose logging to get detailed information about the library’s operations. This can be particularly useful for understanding the flow of data and pinpointing where things go wrong.

.. code-block:: python

    import logging
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

    # Your code here

- **Check for Dependency Issues**: Ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed and compatible with the versions required by the AI Vision Library. Use a virtual environment to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

- **Test with Simplified Inputs**: If a complex operation fails, try simplifying the inputs. For example, use smaller images or a limited dataset to isolate the issue.

- **Validate Inputs and Outputs**: Add checks to validate that inputs (such as images or model files) and outputs (such as detected objects) are in the expected format and contain valid data.

.. code-block:: python

    # Example of input validation
    if not isinstance(image, np.ndarray):
        raise ValueError("Input image must be a NumPy array")

**Handling Specific Exceptions**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the common errors listed above, it’s important to handle specific exceptions that may arise during runtime.

.. code-block:: python

    try:
        detected_objects = detect_objects(image, threshold=0.5, device='cuda')
    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        print(f"File not found: {e}")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Value error: {e}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

**Reporting Issues**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you encounter an issue that you’re unable to resolve, consider reporting it to the developers. Provide as much detail as possible, including:

- A description of the error and when it occurs.
- The code snippet that produces the error.
- The output or error message you receive.
- Your system configuration, including OS, Python version, and CUDA version (if applicable).

**Conclusion**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Effective error handling is crucial for developing robust applications with the AI Vision Library. By understanding common errors and how to troubleshoot them, you can ensure smoother development and more reliable outcomes.
